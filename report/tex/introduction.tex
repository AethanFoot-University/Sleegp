% Personal informatics

Personal informatics is a term used to refer to devices and software that help people gather
information about themselves, so they can reflect upon it and gain motivation to make changes to
their lifestyle and habits to improve their overall wellbeing. Personal informatics is used for
effectively motivating people to gain self-knowledge, change behaviours. % Gen's source here

The area of personal informatics has started to explode in popularity in recent years mainly due to
the increased availability and usability of affordable hardware. Consumer products such as the
FitBit and Apple Watch allow users to collect data on a wide variety of metrics including heart
rate, blood pressure, motion and many others. Products such as the Neuroon, a wearable EEG eye mask,
and Zeo Sleep Manager Pro, an EEG headband, allow the user to collect information on brain waves for
the purpose of sleep tracking.

Another factor that has contributed to the growth of personal informatics is the ubiquity of
smartphones, meaning that users have an ever-present device that allows them to collect and collate
data from their personal informatics hardware. Many personal informatics apps also add an element of
socially driven competition and gamification, driving users' motivation to continue to use them and
push their friends to also begin using this technology. In addition, there is a larger social force
pushing people to take steps to improve themselves. % Expand on this sentence

\subsubsection{Health Risks}

One crucial problem in the realm of health is sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is defined by
\textcite{BMA:2018aa} as ``a lack of sufficient sleep resulting from disruption to the natural sleep
cycle''. This is important to highlight because as as opposed to fatigue, sleep deprivation isn't
subjective. In accordance to \textcite{Alhola:2007aa}, it was estimated that the main effect of
sleep deprivation was the reduction in cognitive performance. This includes: impaired attention;
longer delays in making decisions; poor quality of decisions and a reduction in long memory. This is
especially important to monitor for individuals who have high risk jobs. In 2010, passenger's lives
were lost when a plane overshot the runway by 600 meters; although concrete details haven't been
exposed, it was claimed that the accident unfolded due to the pilot's severe sleep deprivation
\parencite{BBC:2010aa}. Even in circumstances where the individual isn't responsible for people's
lives, a reduction in cognitive performance is still observed. Hence, the validity of this problem
is justified.
